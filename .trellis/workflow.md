# Development Workflow

---

## Core Principles

1. **Align before you plan** — the most common failure is misalignment, not bad code. Interview the user until the design tree is resolved before writing anything down
2. **Plan before code** — figure out what to do before you start
3. **Specs injected, not remembered** — guidelines are injected via hook/skill, not recalled from memory
4. **Persist everything** — research, decisions, and lessons all go to files; conversations get compacted, files don't
5. **Incremental development** — one task at a time, one vertical slice at a time
6. **The feedback loop is the speed limit** — build behaviour test-first at agreed seams; a slice that can't go red first isn't ready to be built
7. **Shared language** — name things the way `CONTEXT.md` names them, and record hard-to-reverse decisions as ADRs
8. **Capture learnings** — after each task, review and write new knowledge back to spec

---

## Trellis System

### Developer Identity

On first use, initialize your identity:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/init_developer.py <your-name>
```

Creates `.trellis/.developer` (gitignored) + `.trellis/workspace/<your-name>/`.

### Spec System

`.trellis/spec/` holds coding guidelines organized by package and layer.

- `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` — entry point with **Pre-Development Checklist** + **Quality Check**. Actual guidelines live in the `.md` files it points to.
- `.trellis/spec/guides/index.md` — cross-package thinking guides.

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages   # list packages / layers
```

**When to update spec**: new pattern/convention found · bug-fix prevention to codify · new technical decision.

### Task System

Every task has its own directory under `.trellis/tasks/{MM-DD-name}/` holding `task.json`, `prd.md`, optional `design.md`, optional `implement.md`, optional `research/`, and context manifests (`implement.jsonl`, `check.jsonl`) for sub-agent-capable platforms.

```bash
# Task lifecycle
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>" [--slug <name>] [--parent <dir>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <name>          # set active task (session-scoped when available)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source      # show active task and source
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py finish                # clear active task (triggers after_finish hooks)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <name>        # move to archive/{year-month}/
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list [--mine] [--status <s>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-archive

# Code-spec context (injected into implement/check agents via JSONL).
# `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` are seeded on `task create` for sub-agent-capable
# platforms; the AI curates real spec + research entries during planning when needed.
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context <name> <action> <file> <reason>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-context <name> [action]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py validate <name>

# Task metadata
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-branch <name> <branch>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-base-branch <name> <branch>    # PR target
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-scope <name> <scope>

# Hierarchy (parent/child)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>

# PR creation
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create-pr [name] [--dry-run]
```

> Run `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py --help` to see the authoritative, up-to-date list.

**Current-task mechanism**: `task.py create` creates the task directory and (when session identity is available) auto-sets the per-session active-task pointer so the planning breadcrumb fires immediately. `task.py start` writes the same pointer (idempotent if already set) and flips `task.json.status` from `planning` to `in_progress`. State is stored under `.trellis/.runtime/sessions/`. If no context key is available from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or a platform-native session environment variable, there is no active task and `task.py start` fails with a session identity hint. `task.py finish` deletes the current session file (status unchanged). `task.py archive <task>` writes `status=completed`, moves the directory to `archive/`, and deletes any runtime session files that still point at the archived task.

### Workspace System

Records every AI session for cross-session tracking under `.trellis/workspace/<developer>/`.

- `journal-N.md` — session log. **Max 2000 lines per file**; a new `journal-(N+1).md` is auto-created when exceeded.
- `index.md` — personal index (total sessions, last active).

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py --title "Title" --commit "hash" --summary "Summary"
```

### Context Script

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py                            # full session runtime
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages            # available packages + spec layers
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.Y>  # detailed guide for a workflow step
```

<!--
  WORKFLOW-STATE BREADCRUMB CONTRACT (read this before editing the tag blocks below)

  The [workflow-state:STATUS] blocks embedded in the ## Phase Index section
  below are the SINGLE source of truth for the per-turn `<workflow-state>`
  breadcrumb that every supported AI platform's UserPromptSubmit hook
  reads. inject-workflow-state.py (Python platforms) and
  inject-workflow-state.js (OpenCode plugin) only parse them — there is no
  fallback dict baked into the scripts after v0.5.0-rc.0.

  STATUS charset: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+. When the hook can't find a tag, it
  degrades to a generic "Refer to workflow.md for current step." line —
  intentionally visible so users notice and fix a broken workflow.md.

  INVARIANT (test/regression.test.ts):
    Every workflow-walkthrough step marked `[required · once]` must have a
    matching enforcement line in its phase's [workflow-state:*] block. The
    breadcrumb is the only per-turn channel; if a mandatory step isn't
    mentioned there, the AI silently skips it (Phase 1 planning gate
    skip and Phase 3.4 commit skip both manifested via this gap).

  TAG ↔ PHASE scoping:
    [workflow-state:no_task]      → no active task; before Phase 1
    [workflow-state:planning]     → all of Phase 1 (status='planning')
    [workflow-state:planning-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 1
    [workflow-state:in_progress]  → Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4
                                    (status stays 'in_progress' from
                                    task.py start until task.py archive)
    [workflow-state:in_progress-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 2/3
    [workflow-state:completed]    → currently DEAD: cmd_archive flips
                                    status and moves the dir in the same
                                    call, so the resolver loses the
                                    pointer (block kept for a future
                                    explicit in_progress→completed
                                    transition)

  Editing checklist:
    - When you change a [workflow-state:STATUS] block, also check the
      matching phase's `[required · once]` walkthrough steps for sync
    - Run `trellis update` after editing to push the new bodies to
      downstream user projects (block-level managed replacement)
    - Full runtime contract:
      .trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md
-->

## Phase Index

```
Phase 1: Plan    → classify, get task-creation consent, then grill → to-spec → to-tickets
Phase 2: Execute → implement via tdd only after status is in_progress, then code-review
Phase 3: Finish  → diagnose, update spec + domain docs, commit, and wrap up
```

### Request Triage

- Simple conversation or small task: ask only whether this turn should create a Trellis task. If the user says no, skip Trellis for this session.
- Complex task: ask whether you may create a Trellis task and enter planning. If the user says no, do not do broad inline implementation; explain, clarify scope, or suggest a smaller split.
- User approval to create a task is not approval to start implementation. Planning still happens first.

### Planning Artifacts

- `prd.md` — requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Do not put technical design or execution checklists here.
- `design.md` — technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, tradeoffs, compatibility, rollout / rollback shape.
- `implement.md` — execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, and rollback points.
- `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` — spec and research manifests for sub-agent context. They do not replace `implement.md`.
- Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

### Parent / Child Task Trees

Use a parent task when one user request contains several independently verifiable deliverables. The parent task owns the source requirement set, the task map, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review; it normally should not be the implementation target unless it also has direct work.

Use child tasks for deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. Parent/child structure is not a dependency system: if one child must wait for another, write that ordering in the child `prd.md` / `implement.md` and keep each child's acceptance criteria testable.

Create new children with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>`. Link existing tasks with `task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>`, and unlink mistakes with `task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>`.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown when there is no active task (before Phase 1) -->

[workflow-state:no_task]
No active task. First classify the current turn and ask for task-creation consent before creating any Trellis task.
Simple conversation / small task: ask only whether this turn should create a Trellis task. If the user says no, skip Trellis for this session.
Complex task: ask the user if you can create a Trellis task and enter the planning phase. If the user says no, explain, clarify scope, or suggest a smaller split.
[/workflow-state:no_task]

### Phase 1: Plan
- 1.0 Create task `[required · once]` (only after task-creation consent)
- 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]` — `grill-with-docs` → `to-spec` → `to-tickets` (`prd.md`; complex tasks also need `design.md` + `implement.md`)
- 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`
- 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]` — Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Grok, Kimi Code (sub-agent-dispatch platforms only; inline platforms skip)
- 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]` (review gate, then `task.py start`; status → in_progress)
- 1.5 Completion criteria

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 (status='planning') -->

[workflow-state:planning]
Stay in planning. `grill-with-docs` -> `to-spec` (writes `prd.md`, no second interview) -> `to-tickets` only if multi-deliverable. Keep all three in ONE context window.
Lightweight: `prd.md` alone. Complex: + `design.md` + `implement.md`, reviewed before `task.py start`.
Curate `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` before start.
[/workflow-state:planning]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 when codex.dispatch_mode=inline.
     Codex-only opt-in alternate to [workflow-state:planning]. The main agent
     edits code directly in Phase 2, so jsonl curation is skipped —
     the inline workflow loads `trellis-before-dev` instead of injecting JSONL
     into a sub-agent. -->

[workflow-state:planning-inline]
Load `grill-with-docs` and interview until every branch of the design tree is resolved; stay in planning.
Then load `to-spec` to synthesize the thread into `prd.md` — synthesis only, do NOT interview a second time.
Lightweight: `prd.md` can be enough. Complex: finish `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`; ask for review before `task.py start`.
Multi-deliverable scope: load `to-tickets` and split into tracer-bullet child tasks; each child's blocking edges go in its own `prd.md`, never implied by tree position.
Inline mode: skip jsonl curation; Phase 2 reads artifacts/specs via `trellis-before-dev`.
[/workflow-state:planning-inline]

### Phase 2: Execute
- 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress'.
     Scope: all of Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4 (status stays 'in_progress' from
     task.py start until task.py archive; only archive flips it). The body
     therefore must cover every required step from implementation through
     commit, including Phase 3.3 spec update and Phase 3.4 commit. -->

Sub-agent dispatch protocol applies to all platforms and all sub-agents, including native Codex `SubagentStart` context injection with child-side pull fallback, class-2 Gemini/Qoder/Copilot/Reasonix/Trae/Grok/Kimi Code, hook-backed ZCode/Snow, and `trellis-research`: every dispatch prompt starts with `Active task: <task path from task.py current>` before role-specific instructions. On Grok Build, use `spawn_subagent` with `subagent_type` set to the Trellis agent name (e.g. `trellis-implement`). On Kimi Code, dispatch the built-in `coder` / `explore` sub-agent with the matching `.kimi-code/skills/trellis-<role>/SKILL.md` instructions.

[workflow-state:in_progress]
Tools: `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check` / `trellis-research` are sub-agent types (Task/Agent tool). The same-named `trellis-check` SKILL is the old single-agent check this workflow replaced — it self-fixes. Always use the Agent form.
Flow: dispatch `trellis-implement` (drives `tdd`) -> `trellis-check` ×2 parallel (`Axis: standards` / `Axis: spec`, report-only) -> `trellis-update-spec` -> commit (3.4) -> `/trellis:finish-work`.
Main session dispatches and judges; it does not implement, review, or research. Findings go back through `trellis-implement`. Already a sub-agent? Report, don't spawn.
Every dispatch prompt starts `Active task: <path from task.py current>`.
[/workflow-state:in_progress]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress' when
     codex.dispatch_mode=inline. Codex-only opt-in alternate to
     [workflow-state:in_progress]. The main session edits code directly
     instead of dispatching sub-agents. -->

[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]
Flow: `trellis-before-dev` -> `tdd` (red-green-refactor per slice) -> `code-review` -> `trellis-update-spec` -> commit (Phase 3.4) -> `/trellis:finish-work`.
Do not dispatch implement sub-agents in inline mode; `code-review` still spawns its own two review sub-agents.
Read context: `prd.md` -> `design.md if present` -> `implement.md if present`, plus relevant spec/research loaded by skills.
[/workflow-state:in_progress-inline]

### Phase 3: Finish
- 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`
- 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`
- 3.4 Commit changes `[required · once]`
- 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

> Note: step 3.1 was folded into 2.2 (last-iteration full-scope check) and 3.4 (commit preamble). Numbering kept stable to avoid breaking external references.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='completed'.
     Currently DEAD in normal flow: cmd_archive writes status='completed' in
     the same call that moves the task dir to archive/, so the active-task
     resolver loses the pointer and the hook never fires on archived tasks.
     Block preserved for a future status-transition redesign (e.g. an
     explicit in_progress→completed command). Edit through the same spec
     channel as the live blocks. -->

[workflow-state:completed]
Code committed. Run `/trellis:finish-work`; if dirty, return to Phase 3.4 first.
[/workflow-state:completed]

### Rules

1. Identify which Phase you're in, then continue from the next step there
2. Run steps in order inside each Phase; `[required]` steps can't be skipped
3. Phases can roll back (e.g., Execute reveals a prd defect → return to Plan to fix, then re-enter Execute)
4. Steps tagged `[once]` are skipped if the output already exists; don't re-run
5. Artifact presence informs the next step; missing `design.md` / `implement.md` is valid for lightweight tasks and incomplete planning for complex tasks.

### Active Task Routing

When a user request matches one of these intents inside an active task, route first, then load the detailed phase step if needed.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

- Planning or unclear requirements -> `grill-with-docs`; ready to write it down -> `to-spec`; multi-deliverable -> `to-tickets`.
- `in_progress` implementation -> dispatch `trellis-implement` (it drives `tdd`); verification -> dispatch `trellis-check` twice in parallel (`Axis: standards`, `Axis: spec`); research -> dispatch `trellis-research` (it drives `research`).
- Something broken or a hard bug -> `diagnosing-bugs`. Terminology or a hard-to-reverse decision -> `domain-modeling`. Module shape / seams -> `codebase-design`. Spec updates -> `trellis-update-spec`.

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

- Planning or unclear requirements -> `grill-with-docs`; ready to write it down -> `to-spec`; multi-deliverable -> `to-tickets`.
- Before editing -> `trellis-before-dev`; building behaviour -> `tdd`; after editing -> `code-review`.
- Something broken or a hard bug -> `diagnosing-bugs`. Terminology or a hard-to-reverse decision -> `domain-modeling`. Module shape / seams -> `codebase-design`. Spec updates -> `trellis-update-spec`.

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

### Guardrails

- Task creation approval is not implementation approval; implementation waits for `task.py start` after artifact review.
- PRD-only is valid for lightweight tasks; complex tasks need `design.md` + `implement.md`.
- Planning must be persisted to task artifacts; checks must run before reporting completion.

### Loading Step Detail

At each step, run this to fetch detailed guidance:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <step>
# e.g. python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.1
```

---

## Phase 1: Plan

Goal: classify the request, get task-creation consent when a task is needed, and produce the planning artifacts required before implementation.

#### 1.0 Create task `[required · once]`

Create the task directory only after task-creation consent. The command sets status to `planning`, writes `task.json`, creates a default `prd.md`, and auto-targets the new task when session identity is available:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<task title>" --slug <name>
```

`--slug` is the human-readable name only. Do **not** include the `MM-DD-` date prefix; `task.py create` adds that prefix automatically.

For task trees, create the parent task first and then create each child with `--parent <parent-dir>`. Do not start the parent just because children exist; start the child that owns the next independently verifiable deliverable.

After this command succeeds, the per-turn breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:planning]`, telling the AI to stay in planning.

Run only `create` here — do not also run `start`. `start` flips status to `in_progress`, which switches the breadcrumb to the implementation phase before planning artifacts are reviewed. Save `start` for step 1.4.

Skip when `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source` already points to a task.

#### 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]`

This step has three stages. Run them in order, in **one unbroken context window** — the spec wants the grilling verbatim as a primary source, not a summary of it. If the window approaches its limit before the split is done, compact at a stage boundary rather than pushing on degraded.

**Stage 1 — Grill.** Load the `grill-with-docs` skill and interview the user until every branch of the design tree is resolved. It runs the `grilling` primitive together with `domain-modeling`, so the interview also sharpens `CONTEXT.md` and records hard-to-reverse decisions as ADRs under `docs/adr/`.

The rules that make the interview work:
- Facts are your job, decisions are the user's — research before asking
- One question at a time; prefer offering options over open-ended questions
- Name things the way `CONTEXT.md` names them; a term that isn't in the glossary is a signal, not a gap to paper over

If a question needs a *runnable* answer — a state model, a piece of business logic, a UI you have to see — detour through the `prototype` skill and bring the finding back before continuing.

**Stage 2 — Spec.** Load the `to-spec` skill to synthesize the thread into the task's `prd.md`. **Do not interview again** — `to-spec` is pure synthesis of what stage 1 already settled. Before writing, sketch the seams you'll test the feature at, prefer existing seams to new ones, use the highest seam possible, and check those seams with the user.

Write into the Trellis task artifacts, not into a tracker (see `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`):
- `prd.md` — problem statement, solution, an extensive numbered list of user stories, implementation decisions, testing decisions, out of scope
- `design.md` (complex tasks) — technical design
- `implement.md` (complex tasks) — ordered execution checklist, validation commands, rollback points

Keep `prd.md` free of file paths and code snippets; they go stale. The exception is a snippet a prototype produced that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can.

**Stage 3 — Split (only when the scope has several independently verifiable deliverables).** Load the `to-tickets` skill and break the spec into **tracer-bullet vertical slices**: each cuts a narrow but complete path through every layer, is demoable on its own, and fits in a single fresh context window. Prefactoring goes first — make the change easy, then make the easy change. Wide mechanical refactors are the exception: sequence them expand → migrate in batches → contract instead of forcing a vertical slice.

Present the breakdown, iterate with the user until approved, then create one child task per slice with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>` and write each child's blocking edges into its own `prd.md`.

When considering a parent/child split:
- Use a parent task when one request contains several independently verifiable deliverables.
- Parent tasks own source requirements, child-task mapping, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review.
- Child tasks own actual deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently.
- Parent/child structure is not a dependency system. If child B depends on child A, write that ordering in child B's `prd.md` / `implement.md`.
- Start the child task that owns the next deliverable. Do not start the parent unless the parent itself has direct implementation work.

Return to this step whenever requirements change and revise the relevant artifact.

#### 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`

Research can happen at any time during requirement exploration. It isn't limited to local code — you can use any available tool (MCP servers, skills, web search, etc.) to look up external information, including third-party library docs, industry practices, API references, etc.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Spawn the research sub-agent. The main session never does the reading itself — that is the whole point, so the legwork never lands in the planning context:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-research`
- **Task description**: Research <specific question>
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`.

The sub-agent loads the `research` skill for anything external, so every claim traces back to a **primary source** rather than a secondary write-up; internal codebase questions it answers with Glob/Grep/Read directly.

- **Key requirement**: output MUST be persisted to `{TASK_DIR}/research/<topic>.md`, one file per topic, with citations
- It replies with **file paths plus one-line summaries only**, never full content. Read a file when you actually need it, not before
- What it produces is material to take *into* the grilling — research feeds the thinking, it doesn't replace it

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Do the research in the main session directly and write findings into `{TASK_DIR}/research/`. `codex-inline` is the explicit mode that keeps work in the main session.

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

**Research artifact conventions**:
- One file per research topic (e.g. `research/auth-library-comparison.md`)
- Record third-party library usage examples, API references, version constraints in files
- Note relevant spec file paths you discovered for later reference

Brainstorm and research can interleave freely — pause to research a technical question, then return to talk with the user.

**Key principle**: Research output must be written to files, not left only in the chat. Conversations get compacted; files don't.

#### 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` so the Phase 2 sub-agents get the right spec/research context. These files were seeded on `task create` with a single self-describing `_example` line; your job here is to fill in real entries.

**Location**: `{TASK_DIR}/implement.jsonl` and `{TASK_DIR}/check.jsonl` (already exist).

**Format**: one JSON object per line — `{"file": "<path>", "reason": "<why>"}`. Paths are repo-root relative.

**What to put in**:
- **Spec files** — `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` and any specific guideline files (`error-handling.md`, `conventions.md`, etc.) relevant to this task
- **Research files** — `{TASK_DIR}/research/*.md` that the sub-agent will need to consult

**What NOT to put in**:
- Code files (`src/**`, `packages/**/*.ts`, etc.) — those are read by the sub-agent during implementation, not pre-registered here
- Files you're about to modify — same reason

**Split between the two files**:
- `implement.jsonl` → specs + research the implement sub-agent needs to write code correctly
- `check.jsonl` → specs for the check sub-agent (quality guidelines, check conventions, same research if needed)

These manifests do not replace `implement.md`. `implement.md` is the human-readable execution plan for a complex task; jsonl files only list context files to inject or load.

**How to discover relevant specs**:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
```

Lists every package + its spec layers with paths. Pick the entries that match this task's domain.

**How to append entries**:

Either edit the jsonl file directly in your editor, or use:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" implement "<path>" "<reason>"
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" check "<path>" "<reason>"
```

Delete the seed `_example` line once real entries exist (optional — it's skipped automatically by consumers).

Ready gate: both `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must contain at least one real `{"file": "...", "reason": "..."}` entry before `task.py start`. The seed `_example` row alone is not ready.

Skip this step only when both files already have real curated entries.

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Skip this step. Context is loaded directly by the `trellis-before-dev` skill in Phase 2.

#### 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]`

After artifact review, flip the task status to `in_progress`:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <task-dir>
```

For lightweight tasks, `prd.md` can be enough. For complex tasks, `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` must exist and be reviewed before start. On sub-agent-dispatch platforms, `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must both have real curated entries before start. Runtime consumers tolerate missing or seed-only manifests for compatibility, but that tolerance is not a planning-ready state.

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:in_progress]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

If `task.py start` errors with a session-identity message (no context key from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or platform-native session env), follow the hint in the error to set up session identity, then retry.

## Phase 2: Execute

Goal: turn reviewed planning artifacts into code that passes quality checks.

#### 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, CodeBuddy, Droid, Pi, ZCode, Snow, Oh My Pi]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts one vertical slice at a time via the `tdd` skill, at the seams the artifacts already agreed on; consult materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; run single test files as you go and the full lint / type-check / test suite once at the end
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement`.

The sub-agent drives `tdd` internally — red first, then green, then refactor, one behaviour slice at a time. It does not commit; committing is Phase 3.4.

The platform hook/plugin auto-handles:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- For Codex, `SubagentStart` supplies native context injection; the agent profile keeps child-side loading as the fallback

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, CodeBuddy, Droid, Pi, ZCode, Snow, Oh My Pi]

[Gemini, Qoder, Copilot, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running project lint and type-check
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then explicitly say the spawned agent is already `trellis-implement` and must implement directly without spawning another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The pull-based sub-agent definition auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Resolves the active task with `task.py current --source`, then reads `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and requires the agent to load each referenced spec/research file before coding

[/Gemini, Qoder, Copilot, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[Kiro]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running project lint and type-check
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform prelude auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present

[/Kiro]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

1. Load the `trellis-before-dev` skill to read project guidelines
2. Read `{TASK_DIR}/prd.md`, then `design.md` if present, then `implement.md` if present
3. Consult materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`
4. Load the `tdd` skill and build the work one vertical behaviour slice at a time — red first, then green, then refactor — at the seams the artifacts already agreed on
5. Run project lint and type-check
[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

#### 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Dispatch `trellis-check` **twice, in parallel — one dispatch per axis**. The two axes stay in separate contexts so neither masks the other, and neither review lands in yours:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-check` (two concurrent dispatches)
- **Dispatch A**: `Active task: <task path>` / `Axis: standards` / `Fixed point: <ref>` — does the diff follow `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/` for the layers it touches, plus the agent's own Fowler smell baseline? Also reports lint / type-check.
- **Dispatch B**: `Active task: <task path>` / `Axis: spec` / `Fixed point: <ref>` — does the diff faithfully implement `prd.md` (+ `design.md` / `implement.md` when present)? This axis is deliberately blind to coding standards.
- **Fixed point**: the merge-base with the task's base branch (`task.py set-base-branch` records it); fall back to the commit the task started from.

Each returns a report under 400 words. The check agents **review only** — they have no write tools, by design: a reviewer that silently fixes hides what it changed.

Apply the findings by re-dispatching `trellis-implement` with both reports attached, or fix trivial ones inline, then re-dispatch both axes until clean. Present the two reports separately and **do not merge or rerank findings across axes** — the separation is what stops a loud axis from masking a quiet one.

The `code-review` skill stays installed for out-of-band use — reviewing a whole branch or PR against an arbitrary fixed point, outside the task flow. Don't load it here; it would duplicate this step in the main context.

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Load the `code-review` skill and let it run the two-axis review of the diff:
- **Standards** — does the diff follow `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/` for the layers it touches, plus its own Fowler smell baseline?
- **Spec** — does the diff faithfully implement `prd.md` (+ `design.md` / `implement.md` when present)?

`code-review` spawns its own two review sub-agents. That is the one spawn inline mode allows — it is a skill loaded in the main session, not a sub-agent dispatch. Do NOT load the `trellis-check` skill here; it is the old single-agent check this workflow replaced.

If issues are found → fix → re-check, until green.
[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

**Final pass (before Phase 3.4 commit)**: the last 2.2 of a task must run full-scope, not just on the latest implement chunk. List all affected packages with `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages`, then load each package's spec index Quality Check section. This catches cross-layer / multi-package issues a mid-iteration local 2.2 cannot.

#### 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

- `check` reveals a prd defect → return to Phase 1, fix `prd.md`, then redo 2.1
- Implementation went wrong → revert code, redo 2.1
- Need more research → research (same as Phase 1.2), write findings into `research/`

---

## Phase 3: Finish

Goal: ensure code quality, capture lessons, record the work.

#### 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`

If this task involved repeated debugging (the same issue was fixed multiple times), load the `diagnosing-bugs` skill. It refuses to theorise until there is a **tight feedback loop** — one command that already goes red on *this* bug — then minimises, hypothesises, instruments, fixes, and locks the fix down with a regression test.

Its post-mortem asks the question that matters here: was the real finding that there was **no good seam** to pin the bug to? If so, that's a `codebase-design` problem, and the finding belongs in `.trellis/spec/` at step 3.3.

`trellis-break-loop` remains available when you only want the 5-dimension root-cause classification without rebuilding a feedback loop.

#### 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`

Load the `trellis-update-spec` skill and review whether this task produced new knowledge worth recording:
- Newly discovered patterns or conventions
- Pitfalls you hit
- New technical decisions

Update the docs under `.trellis/spec/` accordingly. Even if the conclusion is "nothing to update", walk through the judgment.

Then make the same judgment about the **domain** docs, which are a different thing (see `docs/agents/domain.md`): if this task settled what a term means, or made a hard-to-reverse decision, load `domain-modeling` and update `CONTEXT.md` or add an ADR under `docs/adr/`. Rule of thumb — a naming or modelling decision goes in `CONTEXT.md` / an ADR; a coding convention or a pitfall to avoid goes in `.trellis/spec/`.

#### 3.4 Commit changes `[required · once]`

**Spec-sync preamble**: before drafting commits, ask: did this task fix a bug or surface non-obvious knowledge that should land in `.trellis/spec/` so future-you (or future-AI) doesn't repeat the mistake? If yes, return to Phase 3.3 first — spec writes belong in the same task's commit batch, not as a forgotten follow-up.

The AI drives a batched commit of this task's code changes so `/finish-work` can run cleanly afterwards. Goal: produce work commits FIRST, then bookkeeping (archive + journal) commits land after — never interleaved.

**Step-by-step**:

1. **Inspect dirty state**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   Snapshot every dirty path. If the working tree is clean, skip to 3.5.

2. **Learn commit style** from recent history (so drafted messages blend in):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   Note the prefix convention (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` ...), language (中文/English), and length style.

3. **Classify dirty files into two groups**:
   - **AI-edited this session** — files you wrote/edited via Edit/Write/Bash tool calls in this session. You know what changed and why.
   - **Unrecognized** — dirty files you did NOT touch this session (could be the user's manual edits, leftover WIP from a previous session, or unrelated work). Do NOT silently include these.

4. **Draft a commit plan**. Group AI-edited files into logical commits (1 commit per coherent change unit, not 1 commit per file). Each entry: `<commit message>` + file list. List unrecognized files separately at the bottom.

5. **Present the plan once, ask for one-shot confirmation**. Format:
   ```
   Proposed commits (in order):
     1. <message>
        - <file>
        - <file>
     2. <message>
        - <file>

   Unrecognized dirty files (NOT in any commit — confirm include/exclude):
     - <file>
     - <file>

   Reply 'ok' / '行' to execute. Reply with edits, or '我自己来' / 'manual' to abort.
   ```

6. **On confirmation**: run `git add <files>` + `git commit -m "<msg>"` for each batch in order. Do not amend. Do not push.

7. **On rejection** (user replies "不行" / "我自己来" / "manual" / any pushback on the plan): stop. Do not attempt a second plan. The user will commit by hand; you skip ahead to 3.5 once they confirm.

**Rules**:
- No `git commit --amend` anywhere — three-stage three-commit flow (work commits → archive commit → journal commit).
- Never push to remote in this step.
- If the user wants different message wording but accepts the file grouping, edit the message and re-confirm once — but if they reject the grouping, exit to manual mode.
- The batched plan is one prompt; do not prompt per commit.

#### 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

After the above, remind the user they can run `/finish-work` to wrap up (archive the task, record the session).

## Customizing Trellis (for forks)

This section is for developers who want to modify the Trellis workflow itself. All customization is done by editing this file; the scripts are parsers only.

### Changing what a step means

Edit the corresponding step's walkthrough body in the Phase 1 / 2 / 3 sections above. Critical invariants:
- No active task must triage first and ask for task-creation consent before creating a Trellis task.
- Planning must distinguish lightweight PRD-only tasks from complex tasks that require `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before start.
- Every required execution path must keep the Phase 3.4 commit reminder reachable before `/trellis:finish-work`.

All tag blocks live in the `## Phase Index` section above, immediately after each phase summary:

| Scope | Corresponding tag |
|---|---|
| No active task (before Phase 1) | `[workflow-state:no_task]` (after the Phase Index ASCII art) |
| All of Phase 1 (task created → ready for implementation) | `[workflow-state:planning]` (after Phase 1 summary) |
| Codex inline Phase 1 | `[workflow-state:planning-inline]` |
| Phase 2 + Phase 3.2–3.4 (implementation + check + wrap-up) | `[workflow-state:in_progress]` (after Phase 2 summary) |
| Codex inline Phase 2 + Phase 3.2–3.4 | `[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]` |
| After Phase 3.5 (archived) | `[workflow-state:completed]` (after Phase 3 summary; **currently DEAD**) |

### Changing the per-turn prompt text

Directly edit the body of the corresponding `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block. After editing, run `trellis update` (if you're a template maintainer) or restart your AI session (if you're customizing your own project) — no script changes required.

### Adding a custom status

Add a new block:

```
[workflow-state:my-status]
your per-turn prompt text
[/workflow-state:my-status]
```

Constraints:
- STATUS charset: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (underscores and hyphens allowed, e.g. `in-review`, `blocked-by-team`)
- A lifecycle hook must write `task.json.status` to your custom value, otherwise the tag is never read
- Lifecycle hooks live in `task.json.hooks.after_*` and bind to one of `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`

### Adding a lifecycle hook

Add a `hooks` field to your `task.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_finish": [
      "your-script-or-command-here"
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported events: `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`. Note that `after_finish` ≠ a status change (it only clears the active-task pointer); use `after_archive` for "task is done" notifications.

### Full contract

For the workflow state machine's runtime contract, the locations of all status writers, pseudo-statuses (`no_task` / `stale_<source_type>`), the hook reachability matrix, and other deep details, see:

- `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md` — runtime contract + writer table + test invariants
- `.trellis/scripts/inject-workflow-state.py` — actual parser (reads workflow.md only, no embedded text)
